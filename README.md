# Credit Card Transaction Analysis Dashboard

## Project Description

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of credit card transaction data. It is designed to help business analysts, product managers, and executives understand customer behavior, identify revenue streams, and monitor overall financial performance.

The dashboard allows users to dynamically filter data by date, customer demographics (gender, income level), and card type to gain deeper, more specific insights.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Tracked

The main dashboard highlights four critical KPIs that provide a top-level summary of business activity:

* **Total Revenue:** The total income generated by the company from all sources, including fees and interest. This is the primary measure of overall financial success.
* **Total Interest:** The total amount of interest earned from customers, a key component of the company's profit.
* **Transaction Amount:** The total monetary value of all purchases made by customers using their credit cards. This indicates the volume of spending processed.
* **Transaction Count:** The total number of individual transactions, showing how frequently customers are using their cards.

## Dashboard Visualizations & Insights

The dashboard is composed of several charts that break down the data to reveal trends and patterns:

* **Qtr Revenue & Transaction Count:** A dual-axis chart that tracks both revenue and the number of transactions over different quarters, helping to identify seasonal trends and business growth.

* **Breakdown by Card Category:** A table that details Revenue, Interest Earned, and Annual Fees for each card type (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum). This helps identify the most profitable card products.

* **Revenue by Expenditure Type:** A bar chart showing which spending categories (e.g., Bills, Entertainment, Fuel) generate the most revenue, revealing customer spending habits.

* **Revenue by Demographics (Education & Job):** Two separate charts that segment revenue based on the customer's education level and job type. This is crucial for understanding the profile of the most valuable customers.

* **Revenue by Use Chip:** This chart shows the breakdown of revenue from different transaction methods (Swipe, Chip, Online), highlighting the adoption of new payment technologies.

* **Customer Acquisition Cost (Acq Cost):** This visualizes the cost to acquire a new customer for each card tier. Comparing this with revenue helps assess the profitability of marketing efforts.
